## Order of things to talk about

1. Math tests
2. Home tests
3. Count tests
4. ChildComponent tests
5. ParentComponent tests

## Things this doesn't cover

- Network requests
- beforeEach()/afterEach()/afterAll()

## TODO

[ ] write an explenation for --coverage
[ ] using the terminal instead of vsCode extension
